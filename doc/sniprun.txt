==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                           *sniprun-intro*

Sniprun is a code runner plugin that run, and if necessary, compile beforehand, snippets (visual selection)
of your code.


==============================================================================
QUICK START                                       *sniprun-quickstart*




:'<'>Sniprun        Send current visual selection (line-wise) to Sniprun
:SnipRun            Send the current line to Sniprun


:SnipReset    Restart sniprun (that will also clear the cache that helps Sniprun compile faster)


==============================================================================
ALL COMMANDS                                       *sniprun-comands*

:SnipRun                 Send the current line/visual selection to Sniprun

:SnipReset               Restart sniprun (that will also clear the cache that helps Sniprun compile faster)

:SnipReplMemoryClean     If you sent incorrect code to a interpreter with enabled REPL mode, you can clear the 
                         REPL 'memory' with that. It will forget all variables you have defined previously etc..

:SnipTerminate          Kill Sniprun and child processes (equivalent to SnipReset but does not clean the cache)

:SnipInfo               Get Sniprun version info and info about the available intepreters


==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                       *sniprun-configuration*

Sniprun interpreters can be chosen (in case multiple interpreters are available for one filetype) by 
specifying the variable (a list) in your config:

    let g:SnipRun_select_interpreters = ["name_of_favorite_interpreter"]

so that (/these) will be chosen over any other when compatible with filetype.


If you want to enable/disable REPL behavior of some interpreters, you can set:

    g:SnipRun_repl_behavior_enable
and
    g:SnipRun_repl_behavior_disable

to a list of interpreter names to force/forbid REPL behavior.

==============================================================================
